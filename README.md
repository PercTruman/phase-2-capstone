Gravy Train Fundraiser: Student Interface

This app is designed for a student involved in a fundraising project.  Prior to using this app, the student has acquired a list of contacts who have promised to make a donation to the student's cause.

This app is designed to be used on the day of a phone-a-thon, where the student will be tasked will calling/texting/emailing all of their contacts in the hopes of actually getting the donation logged.

Future functionality will include a login screen.  This will be added in phase 3 or 4 of my time at Flatiron.  Therefore the primary interface is a list of contact 'cards' with a prospective donor's name, and whether or not they've committed to donating.  If the user chooses, they can click on a 'show details' link to display the donor's contact information, which can then be used for emailing, calling, or texting.  Additional functionality involves a search bar which allows the student to select a particular donor's information. This is particularly beneficial if the list of prospective donors if large.  Also, if the student want to see only the donors who haven't yet donated, there is a checkbox for this also.

Additionally, there is an "add new donor" form which allows the students to type in a new prospective donor.  This will be useful in the days leading up to the phone-a-thon itself.
