As we begin another exciting marching season, one of the most important things that we do is raise money for our program. The money we raise from this event will help us supplement our competitions, travel, uniforms, props, clinicians, scholarships, and allow us to provide the best experience possible for the students in our band program. We really appreciate your support and donation to our band program. Donâ€™t forget to help spread the word on Social Media about our fundraiser by sharing it with your friends. GO Tiger Band!
